## Screenshots

## Getting Started

Except for the regular modules (git, Node, npm), you need the following modules to run 

* [Expo XDE](https://www.expo.io) - the Expo development environment.
  ```npm install -g exp```

## Installation

1. Clone this repo and enter!

```
git clone https://github.com/adriapalleja/fair-trade.git
cd fair-trade
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install

```

3. Run the app

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the [Expo app](https://expo.io) to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

Update your network IP value in .env file

Run also your backend with node index.js
